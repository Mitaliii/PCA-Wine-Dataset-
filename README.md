# PCA-Wine-Quality-Prediction

We want to investigate what properties of wine define its quality.
We also want to see which of those properties are required to predict the quality of wine. This way we can safely ignore the unnecessary information next time we collect new data.
We will see how algorithm performs(predicts) data before and after applying dimensionality reduction(PCA).

The goal of PCA is to identify and detect the correlation between attributes. If there is a strong correlation and it is found. Then PCA reduces the dimensionality.
So, PCA does this job-
The Principal Component Analysis reduces the dimensions of a d-dimensional dataset by projecting it onto a k-dimensional subspace (where k<d).
